Thanks to [UniItem](https://github.com/ProjectUnified/UniItem), the plugin now has support for custom items from many item plugins.

The key for these items would be in the format:
```
<type>:<id>
```
- `<type>`: The type of the plugin that the item belongs to
- `<id>`: The ID of the item

[Here are a list of supported plugins and their types](https://github.com/ProjectUnified/UniItem#supported-plugins)

Here are some examples from some item plugins:
- ItemsAdder: `ITEMSADDER:your_item`
- Oraxen: `ORAXEN:onyx_axe`
- Nexo: `NEXO:my_item`

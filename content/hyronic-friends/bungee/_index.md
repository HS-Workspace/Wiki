> [!CAUTION]
> **HyronicFriends** has two versions: one for bukkit and one for BungeeCord. The BungeeCord/Velocity version is just a middleware (I will also call it's "middleware" in this instruction), it will not work if you don't have the bukkit version in your server. Then, just follow our instructions for the most accurate installation.

### Download middleware plugin

*   For **HyronicFriends-BungeeCord** plugin, it is available on [**SpigotMC**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/111996/) for free.
*   For **HyronicFriends-Velocity** plugin, you can download it via [**this link**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1geN9syPCeAV3zagl65sIh9OsRXBF27mk?usp=sharing).

### Installation Guide

*   Step 1: Put the **middleware** jar file into **/\[BungeeCord/Velocity\]/plugins/** folder.
*   Step 2: Load the BungeeCord/Velocity for the first time.
*   Step 3: Open the **config.yml** file and configure it. Any changes made after being officially used may result in data loss.
*   Step 4: Go to your **HyronicFriends** folder (start your server if you don't see it) for bukkit/spigot/paper version. Open the **config.yml** file, then change the value of **`MultiNetworks`** to **`true`**, and **`Database.Type`** to **`MySQL`**. Make sure you stopped your server before changing.
*   Step 5: Start your BungeeCord/Velocity first, then your servers.
